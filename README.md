# Predicting Subscription Churn using Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews

**Overview:**

This project aims to predict customer churn for a subscription service by analyzing the sentiment expressed in customer reviews.  The analysis leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to gauge customer satisfaction and identify at-risk subscribers.  The model developed can help proactively address customer concerns and improve retention rates.  This repository contains the code, data (synthetic for demonstration purposes), and results of the churn prediction analysis.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`

**Example Output:**

The script will print a summary of the analysis to the console, including key metrics such as the accuracy of the churn prediction model and potentially other relevant statistics.  Additionally, the script generates several visualization files (e.g., sentiment distribution plots, churn prediction performance plots) in the `output` directory. These visualizations provide a visual representation of the analysis results and insights into customer sentiment and churn patterns.  The exact output files and their names might vary depending on the specific implementation.


**Data:**

The project utilizes a synthetic dataset for demonstration purposes.  The dataset is included in the `data` directory.  For real-world application, this would need to be replaced with your actual customer review data.

**Future Work:**

* Incorporate more advanced NLP techniques for improved sentiment analysis.
* Explore different machine learning models for churn prediction.
* Develop a user interface for easier interaction and visualization of results.
* Integrate the model into a real-time customer relationship management (CRM) system.
